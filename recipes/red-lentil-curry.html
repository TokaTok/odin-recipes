<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. 
    It's great as a main meal rather than a side dish like the 
    more traditional Indian dhal. Don't let the ingredient 
    list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make. This dish is 
    excellent served with basmati rice.</p>
