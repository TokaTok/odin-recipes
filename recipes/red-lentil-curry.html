<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This red lentil curry is rich and hearty. 
    It's great as a main meal rather than a side dish like the 
    more traditional Indian dhal. Don't let the ingredient 
    list faze you â€” this is an easy dish to make. This dish is 
    excellent served with basmati rice.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<ul>
    <li>2 cups red lentils</li>
    <li>3 cups water, or more as needed</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons curry paste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
</ul>
